# MOST_simscape
MOST (Matlab for Offshore Simulation Tool), is a simulation software for simulating floating offshore wind turbines, hybrid wind-wave energy converters, platform with multiple turbines, actively controlled water ballast. It is developed in MATLAB and Simulink which is a user-friendly language and very flexible for user code modification. Another main advantage of MOST is the reduced computational time compared to established codes such as OpenFAST due to the simplification of the aerodynamic computation. Look-up tables of aerodynamic and mooring loads can be obtained during pre-processing further saving computational time during the simulation. MOST also includes the control of the wind turbine which can be chosen between the baseline blade-pitch control and the ROSCO controller. The equation of motion is solved using the MATLAB Simscape library.
